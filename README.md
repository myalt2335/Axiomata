# What is Axiomata?
Axiomata is built on [StratOS](https://github.com/myalt2335/Stratos-2) but differs in that it features a desktop environment over an entirely console based setup. Most features of StratOS have been ported to Axiomata, but some console environment reliant features have been temporarily disabled while I work on adding them correctly.
